# gotestfmt

[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/fnando/gotestfmt?label=version)](https://github.com/fnando/gotestfmt/releases/latest)

A better format output for golang's tests.

We've all been there... a bunch of tests failing and you have no idea where to
start, because everything looks the same. And that one test failing in the sea
of passing tests? So frustrating. Not anymore!

With `gotestfmt` you'll see a progress output while tests are being executed.
Once tests are done, you'll see an output with only the tests that failed.
Simple and easy!

Here's the before and after:

### Overriding colors

You can override the colors by setting the following env vars:

```bash
export GOTESTFMT_TEXT_COLOR="30"
export GOTESTFMT_FAIL_COLOR="31"
export GOTESTFMT_PASS_COLOR="32"
export GOTESTFMT_SKIP_COLOR="33"
export GOTESTFMT_DETAIL_COLOR="34"
export GOTESTFMT_COVERAGE_BAD_COLOR="31"  # coverage < 60%
export GOTESTFMT_COVERAGE_GOOD_COLOR="32" # coverage > 70%
export GOTESTFMT_COVERAGE_OK_COLOR="33"   # coverage between 100-70%
```

To disable color output completely, just set `NO_COLOR=1`.
